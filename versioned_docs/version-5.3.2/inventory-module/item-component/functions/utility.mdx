## Set Item Simulation State

`Set Item Simulation State` Sets this item's visibility and state of
simulating physics. State of simulating physics will be changed only if the
set root component is a subclass of primitive component. Collisions will be
disabled while the item is invisible and re-enabled when
turned back on to be visible.
* `Visible` : If true item will become visible.
* `Simulate Physics`  : If true state of simulating physics will
be restored. This parameter has no effect when bVisible is set to false and
is only used when bVisible is set to true.
