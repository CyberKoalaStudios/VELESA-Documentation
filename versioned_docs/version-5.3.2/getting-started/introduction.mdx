## VELESA Plugin
 
The VELESA Plugin is a comprehensive and powerful suite of components and tools tailored to simplify the development of complex gameplay mechanics in Unreal Engine 5. Leveraging years of expertise and feedback from the community, VELESA offers advanced systems for locomotion, inventory management, and projectile mechanics, all optimized for multiplayer performance and scalability. 


### VELESA Locomotion
`VELESA Locomotion` delivers highly precise character rotation and aim offset, ensuring fluid, jitter-free animations, even in first-person views. Optimized for multiplayer environments, it utilizes Unreal Engine 5's thread-safe features and asynchronous proxy calls to reduce multiplayer load by relying solely on replicated movement data. Compatible with both character and pawn classes, it seamlessly integrates with any movement component.

### VELESA Inventory
The VELESA Inventory system integrates inventory and equipment management into a single, efficient component. It includes custom serialization and replication for smooth multiplayer performance, enabling persistent item storage and automatic inventory updates when players reconnect. 

### VELESA Projectile
VELESA Projectile provides a robust system for projectile management, featuring a projectile launcher and customizable projectile components. It supports custom penetration and bounce logic, homing, physical material interactions, and physics sub-stepping, ensuring realistic and efficient projectile behavior in multiplayer environments. 

### VELESA Function Library
An expanding library of utility functions created to simplify common game development tasks. It currently includes features such as camera and cursor aim calculations, component retrieval, angle calculations for hit reactions or ricochets, and velocity-based rotation determination.
